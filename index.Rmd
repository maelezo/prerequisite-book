These five lessons are designed to provide a person with the fundamental understanding of the R Programming language.  It will cover data structures, data manipulation, as well as basic data visualization.  The recommended learning approach is to install R and RStudio on a computer or cloud node, and follow along with the provided material and videos.

# Basic Data Structures


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'lubridate', 'dplyr', 'ggplot2', 'tidyr'
), 'packages.bib')
```
